    "# Storefronts Vacancy Analysis for Office Apocalypse Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook analyzes NYC storefront vacancy data to understand **street-level economic vitality** and **neighborhood commercial health** that directly impacts office building desirability and occupancy. Storefront vacancy serves as a real-time indicator of local economic conditions that affects office worker experience and building attractiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Storefront Vacancy Data is Critical:\n",
    "- **Street-Level Economic Health**: Vacant storefronts indicate declining neighborhood vitality\n",
    "- **Office Worker Ecosystem**: Retail and services that support office workers (restaurants, shops, services)\n",
    "- **Pedestrian Activity Indicator**: Active storefronts drive foot traffic and area vibrancy\n",
    "- **Leading Economic Indicator**: Retail vacancy often precedes office vacancy in declining areas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique Street-Level Intelligence Only Storefront Data Provides:\n",
    "- **Immediate Economic Conditions**: Real-time neighborhood commercial health assessment\n",
    "- **Worker Support Ecosystem**: Availability of amenities that office workers need\n",
    "- **Area Desirability**: Vacant storefronts create negative perception and reduce area appeal\n",
    "- **Economic Recovery Signals**: Storefront occupancy recovery indicates neighborhood resilience\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Critical Storefront Analysis:\n",
    "- **Vacancy Clustering**: Areas with high storefront vacancy concentrations\n",
    "- **Business Type Mix**: Essential services vs. luxury retail availability\n",
    "- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal and trend-based vacancy changes\n",
    "- **Proximity Impact**: Distance-based effects on nearby office buildings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact on Office Building Prediction:\n",
    "- High storefront vacancy → Reduced office building desirability, higher vacancy risk\n",
    "- Vibrant retail ecosystem → Premium office locations, stable occupancy\n",
    "- Essential services presence → Worker convenience, lower office turnover\n",
    "- Vacancy trend patterns → Early warning signals for office market decline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Source\n",
    "- **File**: `Storefronts_Reported_Vacant_or_Not_20250915.csv`\n",
    "- **Source**: NYC Department of Small Business Services\n",
    "- **Coverage**: All reported storefronts with vacancy status across NYC"
